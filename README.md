# ProGen Audit Dashboard
The ProGen UI Audit Dashboard provides a centralized, data-driven view of UI quality, compliance, and consistency across the application. Built on top of a comprehensive UI audit checklist (200+ evaluation points), the dashboard transforms raw audit data into actionable insights for design, development, and product teams.
